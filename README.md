# TPNWriter

This is very much a work in progress.  Please do not implement it as it could cause harm to patients.
I have uploaded this as code sample for Angular, I recognize that the keys have been uploaded.  First, thank you for your concern.  The project no longer exists in Firebase, so the keys no longer work.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.
